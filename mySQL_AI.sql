-- ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

-- Through this exploratory data analysis project using MySQL, I examined student performance across multiple 
-- dimensions including gender, parental education, race/ethnicity, and test preparation courses. 
-- The analysis revealed meaningful insights such as differences in average scores between male and female students, 
-- the positive impact of test preparation on performance, and the influence of parental education levels on student outcomes. 
-- Additionally, the study highlighted the top and bottom performers and provided a comparative view of performance 
-- across different ethnic groups.

-- This project demonstrates how SQL can be applied to uncover patterns and insights from educational data, 
-- which can be valuable for educators, policymakers, and students themselves. It also reflects my 
-- ability to work with relational databases, write structured queries, and translate raw data into actionable findings.
